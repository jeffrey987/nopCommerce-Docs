# Shipping settings

This chapter describes how to **set up the shipping details of a store**. Besides the location and warehouses set, there are other things which comprise good logistics.

To manage shipping settings go to **Configuration → Settings → Shipping Settings**.

* Choose to **Display Pickup points on the map** if you want to display them on the Google Maps. Customers should not enter a shipping address and choose a shipping method when this option is selected. Note: You can also specify a fee for the 'Pick Up in Store' option.
* Tick **Free shipping over 'x'**, to enable free shipping for orders over a certain total amount. The following field is then displayed, enabling you to define the value of X:
* In the **Value of X** field, enter the value over which all orders with a total greater than this will qualify for free shipping.
* Calculate 'X' including tax. If it is not ticked, the value is calculated excluding tax.
* Tick **Estimate shipping enabled** to enable customers to see a shipping estimate on the shopping cart page in the public store, as follows:

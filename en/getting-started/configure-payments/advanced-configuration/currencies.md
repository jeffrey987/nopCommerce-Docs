# Currencies

In nopCommerce, **only primary store currency is used,** which is the currency against which all other allowed currencies will be configured. Although nopCommerce allows having multiple currencies for displaying your product prices, the primary currency is used for payment transactions with online payment gateways.

If you are using **an online payment gateway** (such as PayPal, Google Checkout) the amount is sent to the payment gateway and will be the price you entered in primary store currency.

Primary store currency is used only by the store administrators. It is used for setting product prices and does not have to be the same as the published currencies.

If you have only one published currency, the store will not display a currency selector, or any currency symbol with prices. If more than one currency is published, all prices are marked with the currently selected currency. nopCommerce recommends removing any currency that is not required.

nopCommerce uses an **exchange rate** to calculate the amounts for published currencies. The exchange rate is entered when a currency is added or edited. Alternatively, you can use a **real-time exchange** rate service to calculate the amount, and the price of the product is multiplied by the exchange rate provided.

Exchange rates fluctuate on a daily basis. Therefore, you can edit the exchange rate as often as you need in order to stay current. Actual transactions are only handled in your store's primary currency. On credit card transactions, banks will usually make exchanges automatically based on the most current currency values.

To define **currency settings** go to **Configuration → Currencies.**

From the Current exchange rate provider dropdown list, select the exchange rate provider that will be used to get live rates.

> [!NOTE]
> 
> By default in nopCommerce there is only one exchange rate provider available - ECB. To get live rates from ECB you should select EUR as a primary exchange rate currency.

 Select the **Auto update** enabled checkbox, to enable receiving **an automatic update of currency rates every hour.**

> [!NOTE]
> 
> By default, all the currency rates are updated once per hour. You can change currency rates updating settings in System → Schedule task, choose Update currency exchange rates.

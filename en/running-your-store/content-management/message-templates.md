# Message templates

Message templates define the layout, content, and formatting of automated messages sent from your store. They are called transactional emails because each one is associated with a specific type of transaction.

There are several message templates available in nopCommerce by default to notify users about order statuses and so on. To access message templates go to **Content management → Message templates**.

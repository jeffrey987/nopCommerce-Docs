## Wishlists

A wishlist is a list of products that a customer can share with friends, or save to transfer to the cart later. If a wishlist adding is enabled for a product, the **Add to Wishlist** button appears on the product details page in the public store. When a product of different variants is added to a wish list, all of the variants chosen by a customer are included in the wishlist.

> [!TIP]
> 
> For example, if the customer adds the same shirt, but in 2 different colors, each shirt appears as a separate item in the wish list. In case the customer adds the same product to the wish list multiple times, the product appears only once, but with an updated quantity that reflects the number of times the product was added.

A store owner can view all Current Wishlists in **Sales → Current Wishlists**.

# Shipping management

To search for and view shipments go to **Sales â†’ Shipments**.

The top area of the page enables you to search for a shipment by different search criteria:

* **Start date** and **End date** for shipments created between these dates.
* Enter **Tracking number** if you want to find shipments with certain tracking number.
* Use **Country, State/province, County/region, City** to search by a shipment destination.
* Select **Warehouse** for shipments sent from a specific warehouse.
* Click **Load not shipped** checkbox if you do not want to load already shipped items.
* Click **Load not delivered** checkbox if you do not want to load already delivered items.

Select certain shipments to **Set as shipped (selected)** or **Set as delivered (selected)**. You can also **Print packaging slips (selected)** or **Print Packaging slips (all)** to print all packaging receipts.

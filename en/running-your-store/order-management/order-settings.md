In order settings you can define:

* **Order totals on payment info tab** to display a product list and order totals on the payment info tab (one-page checkout).
* To require customers to accept the **Terms of service** before processing the order (**on the shopping cart page**).
* To require customers to accept the **Terms of service** before processing the order (**on the confirm order page**).
* To **Disable "Billing address" step** to disable the billing address step during checkout. The billing address will be pre-filled and saved using the default registration data (cannot be used with guest checkout selected). Ensure the appropriate address fields that cannot be pre-filled are not required (or disabled).
* To **Disable "Order completed" page**, to automatically redirect a customer to the order details page when he places an order.

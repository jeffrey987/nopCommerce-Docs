# Customer roles

The customer roles in nopCommerce enable you to form groups of your web-store users. You can create various groups such as store admins, shoppers, [vendors](xref:en/running-your-store/vendor-management), and other. You can also grant these groups certain rights such as discounted pricing, and other special statuses (such as tax exemption, free shipping, and more) using Access Control List.
